Overview
--------

Auto-MISCHBARES, building upon our `HELAO framework <https://github.com/helgestein/helao-pub>`_,  is designed for high-throughput electrochemical research. It automates the study of different electrolyte and/or electrode materials, different electrochemical protocols in order to characterize the interphase formations at a millimeter scale, enhancing the efficiency of material discovery. This system's significant feature is its ability to autonomously asynchronously orchestrate sequential or parallel experiments, integrated with advanced Quality Control assessments and `MADAP <https://github.com/fuzhanrahmanian/MADAP>`_ for advanced data analysis using AI algorithms. The web interface of Auto-MISCHBARES offers streamlined user control, and its database design adheres to FAIR principles, promoting robust and transparent research in battery material science.
